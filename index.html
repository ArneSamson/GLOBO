    <h2>Week 1: introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In this week, we got an introduction of the course by Filip. We also got
      divided into groups. We have Tia and Hailey from the US, Zaida from Mexico
      and Yannick, Arne, Sidney, Lindsay en Evi from Belgium
    </p>
    <h2>Week 2: making a basic website</h2>
    <p>
      This week, the students from Belgium thaught the others how to make a
      basic website. We told them about different HTML tags and how to use them.
      We also learned how to style our website using CSS.

      how to use different mapping tools and how to use them to visualize data.

    <h2>Week 4: learning design</h2>
    <p>
      This week, we dove into map design, starting with our own stomping
      grounds. It's been a blast plotting out the nooks and crannies of our
      hometowns. From favorite hangout spots to hidden gems, we're turning our
      familiarity into art.

    <h2>Week 5: a group lesson</h2>
    <p>
      This week, we gathered the whole crew, students and teachers alike, for a
      brainstorming session on our dream futures. We kicked back, shared our
      wildest aspirations, and let our imaginations run wild. Watching an
      inspiring video together added fuel to the fire, sparking discussions and
      igniting passions.
    </p>
    <h2>Week 6: final session - what is our view on the future?</h2>
    <p>
      This week marked the end of our coil adventure, but it was just the
      beginning of envisioning our ideal futures. Through stable diffusion, we
      shared our diverse visions, each painting a picture of what we hoped to
      see ahead. It was fascinating to see common threads emerge: nature, flying
      cars, and high-tech marvels. What stood out the most was our collective
      emphasis on preserving nature, a testament to our commitment to the
      environment. As we wrapped up, it was clear that while our dreams may
      vary, our shared values unite us in shaping a brighter, greener tomorrow.

    <p>
      In this stunning collage, crafted by combining various AI models, we catch
      a glimpse of our collective vision for the future. At its heart stands a
      city of tomorrow, with sleek flying cars zipping through the sky, and
      elevated highways weaving seamlessly between towering high-tech buildings.
      Amidst this urban marvel, we see joyous humans strolling along, basking in
      the vibrancy of their surroundings. But what truly sets this future apart
      is the harmonious integration of nature and technology. Amongst the
      skyscrapers and bustling streets, lush green spaces thrive, teeming with
      life and vitality. Here, AI robots coexist alongside humans, their
      metallic forms blending seamlessly with the natural landscape, symbolizing
      a future where technology serves to enhance, not overshadow, the beauty of
      our planet. This collage serves as a testament to our collective
      aspirations for a future that marries innovation with sustainability,
      where progress and nature walk hand in hand towards a brighter tomorrow.
